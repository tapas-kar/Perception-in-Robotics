# Perception-in-Robotics
These files signify the projects that I have worked on for Perception in Robotics.
Since vision is an integral part of robotics, I hope people can learn and teach the same in order to carry the field forward.
Some of these files need Robot Operating System (ROS) support as well as OpenCV functionalities to be run successfully.
